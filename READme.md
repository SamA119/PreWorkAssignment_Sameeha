## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not use any outside resources to complete my submission. Just the steps provided in the prework assignment. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I encountered was I had only some experience in HTML from when I was in high school. I'm recently working on a professional personal 
website using HTML and CSS so I thought this assignment also helped me in my project. 
I overcame this challenge by following the steps provided and observing how everything was working. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Some questions I have are about positioning and styling based on different platforms the game would be played on. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time to work on this project, I would for sure add more complexities to the game to make it more challenging. Maybe even add a timer to it.
